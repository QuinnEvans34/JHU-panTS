This table makes completion auditable. A requirement is not complete until its implementation
artifact and verification evidence exist.

## Status protocol

- `Planned` — mapped to a plan, artifact, and test.
- `In progress` — implementation or validation has started.
- `Verified` — evidence exists and is linked from this table.
- `At risk` — the artifact or test is unlikely to meet its scheduled gate.
- `Deferred` — only valid for optional scope, with a recorded decision.
