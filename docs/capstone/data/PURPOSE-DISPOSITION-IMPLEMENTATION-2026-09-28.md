# Next data slice: purpose-specific rejection and retained decisions

September 28, 2026. Bounded implementation proposal prepared at Quinton's request.
This document defines the next slice; no implementation, new diagnostic package,
cohort, source read or training run was produced by this planning pass.

## Problem and outcome

The approved decisions in PURPOSE-ELIGIBILITY-DECISIONS are currently prose.
The v2 annotation contract has broad allowed uses such as training_target, while the
cohort contract separates train/validation/test roles. Neither alone distinguishes
pancreas-present localization from anatomy-absent robustness or geometry-dependent use.

Implement a narrow, fail-closed purpose check and append-only issues using existing
contracts. It must reject case 78 for pancreas-present localization and hold cases
2/266 for geometry-dependent training, with reviewed evidence linkage. It must never
grant eligibility just because those three exceptions do not apply.

## Inputs and trust boundary

- Explicit requested task/purpose and protected role; no default training purpose.
- Validated study/annotation records and exact source hashes from a pinned manifest.
- Retained decision/evidence bytes and independently reviewed expected hashes.
- The existing approved binary-lineage verifier when a later consumer requires mapping.

Do not trust hashes or permission claims supplied only by the record being evaluated.
Bind each decision to the correct study, annotation/CT as applicable, source snapshot,
evidence identity and requested purpose. A changed source or missing decision requires
review. Do not interpret arbitrary Markdown prose at runtime or route only by case number.

## Contract approach

Reuse data-issue v1 fields: rule_code, entity identity, severity, disposition, evidence,
supersedes_issue_id and resolution_artifact_id. Version the code's supported rule registry
and its purpose mapping; never recover purpose by parsing a human message.

Proposed rules:

| Rule | Applies to | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| PANCREAS_PRESENT_TARGET_EXCLUDED | Verified case-78 source/evidence, pancreas-present localizer | Exclude for that purpose; retain original study and protected membership. |
| PHYSICAL_UNITS_UNRESOLVED | Verified cases 2/266 source/evidence, geometry-dependent training | Hold pending applicable unit evidence. |

Unknown purposes, missing qualification or contradictory/stale evidence are rejected.
The checker returns rejection reasons or a statement that this narrow rule check found
no additional block. The latter is explicitly NOT an eligibility or training authorization.
It must not expose an unconditional eligible=True convenience result.

Keep general quarantine and all other unresolved issues. Do not change a study to globally
excluded because one purpose is inappropriate. Empty pancreas does not imply disease absence.
An anatomy-absent robustness candidate still needs its own qualification, task and metrics.
Broad training_target permission cannot bypass the requested-purpose check.

No new generic serialization layer or v1/v2 migration is proposed. If existing issue fields
cannot represent the required linkage unambiguously, stop and present the precise schema
gap before changing contracts. Future production cohort publication/resolution must invoke
this check alongside source, geometry, annotation, identity and ancestry checks.

## Bounded first implementation

Allowed proposed files: new src/data/purpose_disposition.py and
tests/test_purpose_disposition.py, plus this plan's completion evidence. Read existing
manifest/annotation/identity helpers; do not alter their historical behavior in this slice.
Use invented fixtures only. No real disposition publication until the helper and exact
publication inputs receive review. No legacy training-script integration or Plan 04 code.

Acceptance tests must cover:

1. Case-78-shaped fixture rejected for localizer use without changing membership/inputs.
2. Unknown-unit fixtures held even when their numeric spacing is plausible or grids match.
3. Correct-looking policy with wrong study, source hash, evidence hash or purpose rejected.
4. Missing/unknown/conflicting decisions fail closed; duplicate or dangling references rejected.
5. Broad annotation permission never overrides unresolved purpose/source/identity holds.
6. Absence of these specific exclusions grants no use; robustness receives no automatic promotion.
7. Existing issue history remains intact; later resolution requires new linked evidence.
8. Synthetic manifest/consumer boundary rejects held inputs before selecting members;
   this demonstration is not a completed production cohort loader.
9. Canonical replay is deterministic for identical persisted inputs, including issue IDs/times;
   no mutation, source access or protected-role reassignment.

Run the focused tests and existing non-retrieval suite, keeping Claude's active tests separate.
Review the change before any saved-evidence package publication. Such a publication must use
a new identity, verify retained inputs/outputs and preserve the five-study diagnostic package.

## Route from this slice to the first smoke run

| Step | Required exit evidence |
|---|---|
| Purpose guard | Tests above pass; no eligibility promotion; code/decision linkage reviewed. |
| Source/annotation qualification | Resolve applicable source protocol, geometry, encoding, identity/duplicate protection and allowed-use evidence; explicit holds remain for unresolved cases. Complete G1's required coverage rather than treating five examples as a qualified source. |
| Frozen cohort publication/resolution | Train-role parent/ancestor enforcement, versioned purpose, qualified membership and profile hashes, immutable completion marker, exact replay and altered-package rejection. |
| Preprocessing/run slice | Synthetic orientation/spacing/label and source-space round-trip tests; scratch lineage; immutable run/config/environment/checkpoint records and reload/interruption checks. |
| Exact smoke plan | Pancreas-localizer wiring question, specific cohort/config, seed, steps/time/memory/disk caps and numerical pass/stop criteria recorded before compute. |
| Launch review | R0–R8 in FIRST-EXPERIMENT-READINESS satisfied for that run, storage/restore and exclusive accelerator ownership checked; explicit launch review. |

No numeric training budget or cohort size is invented here. Those follow actual qualified
inputs and small-fixture resource evidence. Every attempt belongs in docs/experiments.md.
No prior project-trained checkpoint reuse, protected-test tuning, source rewriting or
assumption that retrieval must finish before imaging. The publisher reply can resolve a
specific hold later; waiting for it need not stop synthetic engineering or other qualification.
